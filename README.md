# Tech Blog

## Description
Tech Blog is a fully functional, full stack web application. Users may create new profiles, log in to existing profiles, write blog posts, and comment, edit, delete, and upvote existing posts. Passwords are encrypted and safe from devious users. This application uses the MVC file system for ease of use and to help future developers read and understand the code better. Writting a full-stack web app can indeed be daunting, however, when taken one step at a time, the process doesn't seem nearly as difficult. Sometimes it is invaluable to just take a step back for a bit, breathe and re-focus. I find that I often see things a bit more clearly after a break, and this project has driven that idea home. Thanks for reading, and happy coding.
